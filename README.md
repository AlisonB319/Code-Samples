# Code-Samples
This was a web-application term assignment, written with 2 teammates, Amariah Del-Mar and Elizabeth Viele. 

It is a web application where there are teacher and TA accounts. Teachers can request TA's and TA's can accept the position. The teacher can view their courses and their TA's. While the TA's can view the courses that they are TA-ing for. 

It was designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We were not allowed to use any kind of framework. It is supposed to showcase our skills at designing a web-application from front-end to back-end.
