# Code-Samples
This is my final project from CS 122, it is was a group project, where I and two other classmates created this game. As the wizard goes through the levels, its stats increase while the enemys stats increase as well. If you want to run the game yourself, you must include the SFML 32-bit library for Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. Here is game footage.
